00:00:09.007 --> 00:00:09.227
 Okay.

2
00:00:11.288 --> 00:00:12.749
FixIncome Maddy speaking.

3
00:00:12.769 --> 00:00:16.111
Hi Maddy, Martin here from Marshall Brokers.

4
00:00:16.131 --> 00:00:16.631
Happy Friday.

5
00:00:16.830 --> 00:00:17.850
Oh, hi Martin.

6
00:00:17.931 --> 00:00:18.551
Happy Friday.

7
00:00:18.571 --> 00:00:21.753
I just pinged you an ISIN number.

8
00:00:21.873 --> 00:00:24.314
It's regarding a corporate bond you bought about a month ago.

9
00:00:24.333 --> 00:00:28.515
I just got information regarding the company from a good source.

10
00:00:28.574 --> 00:00:31.676
There will be an announcement on Monday which will cause a major sell-off.

11
00:00:32.216 --> 00:00:35.158
Very negative news about the company's current financial status.

12
00:00:36.103 --> 00:00:38.365
 When the market opens on Tuesday, it will be a chaos.

13
00:00:38.405 --> 00:00:42.348
So you have a couple of hours today to get rid of the stuff and avoid major loss.

14
00:00:43.030 --> 00:00:46.112
You have to clear the trade with another broker as I can't be involved.

15
00:00:46.451 --> 00:00:46.753
Okay?

16
00:00:47.914 --> 00:00:48.634
Okay.

17
00:00:49.033 --> 00:00:50.295
Well, that's bad news.

18
00:00:50.756 --> 00:00:51.136
Thank you.

19
00:00:51.195 --> 00:00:52.057
I'll sell stuff.

20
00:00:52.296 --> 00:00:53.137
Well, thanks.

21
00:00:53.677 --> 00:00:54.259
I owe you.

22
00:00:54.978 --> 00:00:55.759
Yes, you do.

23
00:00:55.780 --> 00:00:57.021
Bye for now.

24
00:00:57.902 --> 00:01:02.985
Well, buy anything, you know, find me on WhatsApp or Yahoo.

25
00:01:03.125 --> 00:01:03.826
Thank you very much.

26
00:01:04.326 --> 00:01:04.826
I will do that.

27
00:01:05.087 --> 00:01:05.347
Thanks.

28
00:01:05.447 --> 00:01:05.647
Bye.
